    If you want to use your own type of profiles data and student attributes,
    create subclass of this class, which contains your own student's
    parameters. Then, you need to create StudentCalculator subclass that will compare this student class and profiles.

    class MyStudent(g00dsch00ls.Student):

    Subclasses usage
    ----------------

    If you want to use your own student or profile attributes, you need to create a subclass of StudentCalculator
    (or first create Student subclass, which contains your own student's parameters),
    which contains your compare functions (used in recommendation system to compare profiles and students).

    To add new comparison method, create a method that starts with "compare_"
    and takes student and profile as parameters.
    The method should return a float value, less - better (higher position in ranking).

    Example class:
    class MyStudentCalculator(g00dsch00ls.StudentCalculator):
        def compare_school_type(self, student: MyStudent, profile: pandas.Series) -> float:
            ...
            return score

    Then the method is contained in self.compare_options dictionary and class can be used in recommendation system.
